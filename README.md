Hi there, I'm Devasmita Saha — aka [devasmita.codes] 👋  

🧠 **About Me!**  
✨ Storyteller at heart, analyst by instinct.  
💡 I believe every dataset hides a narrative — one that sparks insight and innovation.  
🤖 Currently exploring how Generative AI is redefining analytics, reasoning, and creativity.  
🎨 Outside of work, I express stories through canvas art, travel moments, and books.  
📚 I also run [@chaptersandcompass](https://www.instagram.com/chaptersandcompass) — where data meets imagination.  

🌱 **Learning:** AI for storytelling, prompt engineering, and decision intelligence.  
👯 **Collaborating on:** Human + AI projects that turn insights into emotions.  
💬 **Ask me about:** Data storytelling, GenAI, or creative analytics!  
📫 **Reach me @** [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devasmitasaha/) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/chaptersandcompass).  
😄 **Fun facts:**  
 • I can turn an ordinary dataset into a cliffhanger.  
 • My dashboards have more personality than most PowerPoints.  
 • I’m always chasing quiet corners — from Pondicherry’s beaches to Bali’s hidden waterfalls.  
⚡ **Dream project:** Blending AI, storytelling, and art to make insights feel... human.
