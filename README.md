# 👋 Hi, I’m Devasmita Saha  

✨ **Senior Data Analyst @ Walmart** with 12+ years of experience transforming data into decisions.  
💡 I believe every dataset hides a story — one that can shape business outcomes, spark innovation, and deepen human understanding.  
🧠 Currently exploring how **Generative AI** is redefining analytics, reasoning, and decision-making in large-scale organizations.  
📝 Passionate about blending **storytelling with data** to make insights not just understandable, but unforgettable.  
🎨 I express creativity through **canvas art, books, and travel stories** — because storytelling exists in every form.  
🌱 Constantly learning, unlearning, and reimagining what’s possible with data and imagination.  
😄 **Fun facts:**  
 • I can turn an ordinary dataset into a cliffhanger.  
 • I’ve been told my dashboards have more personality than most presentations.  
 • My best ideas come while sipping coffee (or while debugging code I broke myself ☕).
